# Galileo Project Score Counter

An Android application designed to replace paper score sheets for the board game **Galileo Project**.

## Project Description
This app provides a digital scoring solution for fans of the Galileo Project board game. It allows players to:
* **Select/Manage Players**: Easily choose 2 to 4 players for a game session.
* **Scoring**: Input scores across all game categories (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Technologies, Assistants, and Goals). The app automatically calculates totals and enforces game-specific scoring limits.
* **Game History**: View a detailed log of previous games, including winners, dates, and full score breakdowns.
* **Theme Support**: Full support for Light and Dark modes, plus a system default option.
* **Ad free**: This app contains no advertisements 

## Localization
The app currently supports:
* **English**
* **Dutch (Nederlands)**

I am committed to making the app accessible to as many players as possible and am willing to add more languages. If you would like to contribute a translation, please feel free to reach out!

## Open Source & Learning
This app was created as a project to learn and practice modern Android development using **Jetpack Compose**, **Room Database**, and the latest **Material 3** design guidelines. 

I am very open to feedback, suggestions, and improvements. If you are a developer and want to help improve the app, I gladly accept **Pull Requests** on GitHub!
